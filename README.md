# udemy-big-10
Sandbox for self-directed learning based on Udemy course "Python: Big 10". My activities here will include:
* Watch lectures
* Do homework problems in "sections"
* Write code following step-by-step lectures for several apps in "projects"
* Tinker with these app designs to modify functionality
* Make some templates for future inspiration
